# matplotlib-challenge

WOW this week was a mess.
I managed to complete everything BUT the boxplot within a reasonable timeframe, generating a DF or series or list to make a boxplot turned out to be incredibly frustrating for me. By the time I made any progress I was so frustrated that I decided to submit the assignment as is, no cleaning or optimizing.  I think I must be approaching the problem all wrong; in my attempt of making a plot with 4 boxplots side by side, I tried pivoting, transposing, rearranging, reindexing and all kinds of weird stuff. In hindsight this is probably something that I should find tutoring or office hour help with.  

All code is (unfortunately) very much my own, though I did reference documentation... like a lot.
